# 🧩 Integration Certification Checklist

## Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core
Version: 0.1.0  
Status: Public (Alpha)

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This checklist defines the requirements for any system claiming compliance with the Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core.  
#### It ensures:

- Deterministic behavior  
- Correct validation  
- Correct scoring  
- Correct proof generation  
- Version alignment  
- Cross‑language consistency  
- Audit readiness  

Integrators must pass all items to be considered certified.

---

### 1. Environment Requirements

#### ✅ 1.1 Deterministic Runtime
- No nondeterministic sources (randomness, system time, external APIs).  
- All timestamps must be provided by the integrator, not generated internally.

#### ✅ 1.2 Stable JSON Handling
- Canonical JSON serialization.  
- No reordering of keys.  
- No lossy parsing.

#### ✅ 1.3 Version Pinning
- Protocol version pinned.  
- Rule versions pinned.  
- Validator versions pinned.

---

### 2. Event Construction Requirements

#### ✅ 2.1 Schema Compliance
Events must include:

- event_id  
- type  
- timestamp  
- payload  
- metadata (optional but recommended)

#### ✅ 2.2 Timestamp Rules
- Must be ISO‑8601.  
- Must pass sanity checks.  
- Must not be generated by the protocol implementation.

#### ✅ 2.3 Payload Structure
- Must match type‑specific requirements.  
- No extraneous fields unless allowed by spec.

---

### 3. Validation Pipeline Requirements

#### ✅ 3.1 Type Validator
- Correctly rejects unknown types.  
- Correctly identifies valid types.

#### ✅ 3.2 Payload Validator
- Enforces required fields.  
- Enforces allowed values.  
- Produces deterministic error messages.

#### ✅ 3.3 Replay Validator
- Rejects duplicate event IDs.  
- Rejects timestamp regressions (if applicable).  
- Deterministic behavior across environments.

#### ✅ 3.4 Rule‑Specific Validators
- Correctly applied based on event type.  
- Deterministic ordering.  
- Deterministic failure modes.

#### ✅ 3.5 Validation Output
- Must match reference implementation byte‑for‑byte.

---

### 4. Scoring Engine Requirements

#### ✅ 4.1 Rule Matching
- Correctly identifies applicable rules.  
- No missing or extra rule matches.

#### ✅ 4.2 Rule Evaluation
- Deterministic evaluation order.  
- No floating‑point math.  
- No environment‑dependent behavior.

#### ✅ 4.3 Score Aggregation
- Pure integer addition.  
- Deterministic ordering.  
- No overflow or truncation.

#### ✅ 4.4 Scoring Output
- Must match reference implementation byte‑for‑byte.

---

### 5. Proof Generation Requirements

#### ✅ 5.1 Proof Structure
Proof must include:

- Event  
- Validation result  
- Score result  
- Protocol version  
- Optional signature  
- No nondeterministic fields

#### ✅ 5.2 Signature Handling
If signatures are used:

- Must be deterministic.  
- Must use approved signature schemes.  
- Must not alter proof structure.

#### ✅ 5.3 Proof Output
- Must match reference implementation structure exactly.

---

### 6. Conformance Test Suite Requirements

#### ✅ 6.1 Fixture Compatibility
Integrator must pass all fixtures in:

`
tests/fixtures/conformance/
`

#### ✅ 6.2 Cross‑Language Consistency
Integrator must produce identical results to:

- JavaScript reference implementation  
- Python reference implementation  
- Rust reference implementation  

#### ✅ 6.3 Error Consistency
Error messages must match exactly.

#### ✅ 6.4 Deterministic Behavior
Repeated runs must produce identical outputs.

---

### 7. Documentation Requirements

#### ✅ 7.1 Integration Guide
Integrator must document:

- How events are created  
- How validation is performed  
- How scoring is performed  
- How proofs are stored or used  

#### ✅ 7.2 Versioning Policy
Integrator must document:

- Protocol version used  
- Rule versions used  
- Validator versions used  

#### ✅ 7.3 Security Considerations
Integrator must document:

- Replay protection strategy  
- Timestamp handling  
- Event ID generation strategy  

---

### 8. Audit Requirements

#### ✅ 8.1 Reproducibility
Auditors must be able to reproduce:

- Validation results  
- Scoring results  
- Proof generation  

#### ✅ 8.2 Deterministic Logs
Integrator must provide logs that:

- Are deterministic  
- Are timestamped externally  
- Do not include nondeterministic fields  

#### ✅ 8.3 Threat Model Alignment
Integrator must demonstrate alignment with:

`
docs/protocol/threat-model.md
`

---

### 9. Certification Decision

#### To be certified:

- All checklist items must be passed.  
- All conformance tests must be passed.  
- All outputs must match reference implementations.  
- No nondeterministic behavior may be present.  

#### Certification is granted by:
