# 🗺️ Protocol Roadmap

## Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core
Version: 0.1.0  
Status: Public Roadmap (Alpha)

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core.  
It provides:

- Transparency for contributors  
- Predictability for integrators  
- Confidence for auditors and partners  
- A shared vision for the GitDigital ecosystem  

The roadmap is intentionally modular and versioned, reflecting the protocol’s deterministic and composable design.

##### Goals
- Establish the core protocol  
- Finalize deterministic validation and scoring  
- Publish the canonical specification  
- Build foundational documentation  
- Provide example implementations  
- Set up governance and compliance frameworks  

##### Deliverables
- Core spec  
- Scoring rules v0.1.0  
- Validation pipeline  
- Proof generation  
- Architecture diagrams
