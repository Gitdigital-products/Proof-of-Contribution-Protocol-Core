# 🏛️ Governance RFC Template

Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core
Version: 0.1.0  
Status: Template

---

## 📘 Purpose

This template standardizes how contributors propose changes to the Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core.  
Every major change — including spec updates, scoring rule modifications, validator additions, or architectural shifts — must be submitted as an RFC.

### RFCs ensure:

- Transparency  
- Determinism  
- Governance alignment  
- Auditability  
- Community review  
- Long‑term maintainability

---

#### 2. Summary

A concise explanation of:

- What the proposal is  
- Why it matters  
- What part of the protocol it affects  

This section should be readable in under 30 seconds.

---

#### 3. Motivation

Explain why this change is needed.

Examples:

- Fixing ambiguity in the spec  
- Improving determinism  
- Adding a new contribution type  
- Updating scoring rules  
- Enhancing security  
- Supporting new integrator use cases  

This section should clearly articulate the problem.

---

#### 4. Proposal

Describe the proposed change in detail.

Include:

- New or modified data structures  
- New or modified validation rules  
- New or modified scoring rules  
- Architectural changes  
- Governance implications  
- Any new terminology  

This is the most detailed section.

---

#### 5. Specification

Provide the exact, deterministic specification of the change.

This may include:

- JSON schemas  
- Pseudocode  
- Rule definitions  
- State diagrams  
- Mermaid diagrams  
- Versioning rules  

This section must be precise enough for independent implementation.

---

#### 6. Rationale

Explain why this design was chosen over alternatives.

Include:

- Tradeoffs  
- Security considerations  
- Determinism considerations  
- Backward compatibility  
- Future extensibility  

---

#### [[]]7. Security Considerations

Describe:

- New attack vectors introduced  
- How they are mitigated  
- Any changes to the threat model  
- Any new trust assumptions  

This section is required for all RFCs.

---

#### 8. Backward Compatibility

Explain:

- Whether the change is breaking  
- How integrators should migrate  
- Whether version bumps are required  
- Whether fallback behavior is needed  

---

#### 9. Alternatives Considered

List other approaches that were evaluated and why they were rejected.

This demonstrates due diligence.

---

####10. Implementation Plan

##### Outline:

- Steps required  
- Components affected  
- Testing requirements  
- Documentation updates  
- Timeline (if relevant)  

---

#### 11. Reference Implementation (Optional)

If available, link to:

- Prototype code  
- Example implementation  
- Test cases  

---

#### 12. Open Questions

List unresolved issues that require community or maintainer input.

---

#### 13. Changelog

Track updates to the RFC itself.

---

#### 14. Appendix (Optional)

Include:

- Diagrams  
- Extended examples  
- Mathematical proofs  
- Benchmarks  
- Prior art
