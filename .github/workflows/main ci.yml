⚙️ 1. CI Pipeline (ci.yml)

`yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
`

Notes:  
- Uses Node.js by default — you can swap for Rust or Python later.  
- Ensures deterministic builds and test coverage.
