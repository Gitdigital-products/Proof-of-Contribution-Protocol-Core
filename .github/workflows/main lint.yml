🧹 2. Linting Workflow (lint.yml)

`yaml
name: Lint

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
`

Notes:  
- Keeps PRs clean and consistent.  
- Prevents nondeterministic or unsafe code from entering the protocol.
