# 🧩 Use Cases

Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core
Version: 0.1.0  
Status: Draft (Alpha)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines practical, real‑world use cases for the Proof‑of‑Contribution Protocol Core.  
It demonstrates how the protocol can be applied across:

- Developer ecosystems  
- Governance systems  
- Community platforms  
- Automation pipelines  
- Reward engines  
- Compliance‑aligned contribution tracking  

These examples help integrators understand how to embed the protocol into their workflows.

---

1. Developer Ecosystem Use Cases

1.1 Code Contribution Scoring
Track and score contributions such as:

- Commits  
- Pull requests  
- Issue triage  
- Code reviews  
- Documentation updates  

### Example:  
A GitHub bot submits contribution events for every merged PR.  
The protocol validates and scores each event, producing proofs used for contributor reputation.

---

1.2 Open‑Source Project Health Metrics
Projects can use contribution proofs to:

- Measure contributor engagement  
- Identify top contributors  
- Detect inactive periods  
- Support governance decisions  

---

1.3 Automated Contributor Recognition
Integrators can automatically:

- Award badges  
- Update contributor dashboards  
- Trigger reward distributions  
- Publish contribution summaries  

---

2. Governance Use Cases

2.1 Weighted Governance Voting
Contribution proofs can be used to:

- Weight votes based on contribution history  
- Prevent sybil attacks (when combined with identity layers)  
- Reward long‑term contributors with increased influence  

---

2.2 Eligibility for Governance Roles
Communities can require:

- Minimum contribution score  
- Verified contribution proofs  
- Domain‑specific contributions  

Before granting:

- Maintainer roles  
- Reviewer permissions  
- Governance seats  

---

3. Community & Social Use Cases

3.1 Community Engagement Tracking
Track contributions such as:

- Discord moderation  
- Forum participation  
- Event hosting  
- Community support  

These can be validated and scored using custom validators.

---

3.2 Reputation Systems
Contribution proofs can feed into:

- Reputation dashboards  
- Contributor leaderboards  
- Trust scoring systems  
- Community badges  

---

4. Automation & Workflow Use Cases

4.1 CI/CD Contribution Hooks
CI pipelines can automatically:

- Submit build/test contributions  
- Score successful deployments  
- Track operational contributions  

---

4.2 Bot‑Driven Contribution Capture
Bots can capture contributions from:

- GitHub  
- GitLab  
- Discord  
- Telegram  
- Notion  
- Jira  

Each event is validated and scored through the protocol.

---

5. Reward & Incentive Use Cases

5.1 Token‑Based Rewards
Contribution proofs can be used to:

- Distribute tokens  
- Allocate grants  
- Reward community participation  
- Incentivize open‑source work  

---

5.2 Bounty Completion Verification
Bounty platforms can:

- Validate completion events  
- Score contribution quality  
- Generate proofs for payout eligibility  

---

6. Compliance & Audit Use Cases

6.1 Transparent Contribution Records
Contribution proofs provide:

- Immutable contribution history  
- Deterministic scoring  
- Auditable validation logic  

#### Useful for:

- Grant programs  
- Compliance reporting  
- Ecosystem transparency  

---

6.2 Cross‑Platform Contribution Verification
Proofs can be verified across:

- Solana programs  
- GitDigital Products  
- Third‑party services  
- Governance systems  

This enables interoperable contribution tracking.

---

7. Enterprise Use Cases

7.1 Internal Contribution Tracking
Enterprises can use the protocol to:

- Track engineering contributions  
- Score internal documentation  
- Measure team engagement  
- Support performance reviews  

---

7.2 Vendor or Partner Contribution Audits
Contribution proofs can validate:

- Vendor deliverables  
- Partner contributions  
- Contractual milestones  

Without exposing sensitive internal systems.

---

8. Future Use Cases

##### Planned extensions enable:

- Zero‑knowledge contribution proofs  
- On‑chain scoring  
- Cross‑ecosystem contribution bridges  
- AI‑assisted contribution classification  
- Reputation decay models  

---

9. Status

This document is in Alpha and will expand as the protocol matures.
